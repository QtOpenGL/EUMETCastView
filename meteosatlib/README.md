This version of the meteosat library only contains the low level meteosatlib library as it is found at
[SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/meteosatlib/files/).
It is used for reading the meteosat images in the EUMETCastView program.
The decompressing is done with the bz2 library. For decrypting the files you need a EUMETSAT key dongle and be registered at Eumetcast.
The source code for decrypting can be obtained by filling in the form at http://oiswww.eumetsat.int/WEBOPS-cgi/wavelet/register.
The libraries created are called DISE, JPEG WT, T4 and COMP.
